## Rambling Preamble

I had some pictures taken at my friends pool that I thought looked pretty hard.
I'm talking album cover material. 
They had some oomph. 
However, I wanted to take it farther, make make it look edgy, make it look cool and glitchy, like they're falling apart on purpose. 

## Datamoshing

Pictures are stored as data on your computer using a particular format, you know, like .jpg, .png, .bmp, (or RAW if you're a loser with an expensive camera).
Some programs on your computer can manipulate data.
You know what one of those programs is?
Audacity!
Yes, the program used to edit AUDIO files.
It's that simple!
You can upload an image file **as if it was an audio file** and then do weird stuff to it!
When you convert it back to image, all sorts of weird corruptions happen to it!
