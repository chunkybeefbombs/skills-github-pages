# Oooh pictures

I had some pictures taken at my friends pool that I thought looked pretty hard.
I'm talking album cover material. 
They had some oomph. 
However, I wanted to take it farther, make make it look edgy, make it look cool and glitchy, like they're falling apart on purpose. 

# Datamoshing

Pictures are stored as data on your computer using a particular format, you know, like .jpg, .png, .bmp, (or RAW if you're a loser with an expensive camera).
Some programs on your computer can manipulate data.
You know what one of those programs is?
Audacity!
Yes, the program used to edit AUDIO files.
It's that simple!
You can upload an image file **as if it was an audio file** and then do weird stuff to it!
When you convert it back to image, all sorts of weird corruptions happen to it!

Please enjoy this short gallery of some of the different effects I played with

## Echo and Reverb
Echo repeats a signal with a time delay, and every sucessive repitition is quieter than the previous. 
Reverb is like an echo, but it's a more complicated acoustic phenomenon where different frequencies are reflected non-uniformly.
I think that the echo has distorted this picture by adding the ghostly outlines (if you equate time with space) and the reverb has distorted the picture with the chromatic shift (if you equate color with frequency).

## Invert
Invert flips the polarity of a sound wave. Peaks become valleys and vice versa. 
I have no idea why it fuzzed out the background but left my skin unchanged.

## Reverse
Reverse just does what it says on the tin. 
The application to data moshing is that when you edit an image as if it was audio, the first few seconds of "audio" are header information that you can't distort without corrupting your picture beyond recognition.
Therefore, if you're going to mess with your image, you have to select a range that doesn't include the header.
How many seconds long is this header?
I have no clue.
I just picked a random amount.
I think that's why the color shift has an abrupt break in the middle of my leg, instead of the regular edge of the photo.

## Wah Wah
Wah is an effect you see on guitar pedal boards that makes the guitar go "wah".
It's like a band pass filter that rocks between letting medium, low, and high frequencies through.
I don't know why this picture is in gray scale, but I assume that the width of those blurring lines is proportional to how fast the "wah" setting sweeps.
