My girlfriend only has one key to her apartment.
Sometimes she has to leave for school or work when it would be inconvenient for me to leave at the same time, but I also need in-and-out privileges before she'd get back.

My first thought was to spoof the digital chip inside her key. I thought it'd be easy because I watched a video on copying a magstrip from an old-fashioned swipe pass using a read-write peripheral for mag strips.
(There were even lower-fidelity options such as picking up the barcode mag strip pattern using iron filings)

There's a reason they don't use swipe cards any more. They're easy to hack! So I guess it's a good thing that it's not easy for me to clone the key. 
The key coding is done with a commercial fob reader/writer that costs $9000 to get your hands on, and there's no way they'd let a sketchy guy like me get my hands on one.

Clearly, the apartment management doesn't want anyone to open doors from the outside if they don't have a legitimate key. So, I should try figuring out how to open the doors from the *inside*, given that I'm already allowed to be inside.
I have a mechanical engineering degree, I should be able to figure out how to turn a deadbolt!
